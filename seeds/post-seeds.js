The same goes for control wardsâ€”both items are a waste of gold and will only serve to delay your victory. You must, of course, stack tear as quickly as possible. For this, take smite to secure blue buff from your jungler. This will free you up to stack both your tear and your passive in lane without limit. Use this whenever blue buff is available. There are two important runes for this build: Manaflow Band and Biscuit Delivery. The biscuits can help keep you in lane, but more than that, each of the three biscuits increases your max mana by 50. Meanwhile, Manaflow Band eventually gives 250 bonus mana, for a combined 400 mana from runes.',
